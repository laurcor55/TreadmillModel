# TreadmillModel
TreadmillModel is a matlab program for FtsZ treadmilling, nucleation and GTP hydrolysis. Users can either run the app in matlab or with the matlab runtime environment. The first requires access to matlab. The second involves installing the matlab runtime environment (included in this folder). 

## Installation and Use - matlab users
For users with access to matlab. 
1. Install matlab from [MathWorks](mathworks.com). Follow download instructions provided by installer. Skip this step if you already have matlab.
2. In web browser, visit [GitLab repository](https://github.com/laurcor55/TreadmillModel). Click 'Clone or Download' and 'Download Zip'. Unzip folder and move to Documents/MATLAB directory.
3. Open matlab and navigate to the TreadmillModel-master directory with either `cd TreadmillModel-master` or with the file path navigation bar. 
4. Run app by typing `RunApp` and enter command window. 

## Installation and Use - non-matlab users
The pre-compiled version of our program can be run with matlab runtime environment. This allows users without matlab to run pre-compiled matlab programs. 

Installation can be found at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). R2019b release is preferred but not required.
